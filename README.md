# Elective Staffing App – Landing Page

This repository hosts a temporary landing page for the Elective Staffing mobile app. The purpose of this page is to provide a stable URL for the QR code used on flyers and promotional materials before the app is officially published.

## What this page does
- Displays a simple "App Coming Soon" message  
- Will later redirect users to the App Store or Google Play once the app is live  
- Allows the same QR code to remain valid before and after launch

## Deployment
This site is deployed using Vercel.  
Any updates committed to `index.html` will be automatically redeployed.

## Post-launch plan
After both the iOS and Android versions are published, this page will be updated with device-based redirection:
- iOS users will be redirected to the App Store  
- Android users will be redirected to Google Play  
- Desktop users may be redirected to a general information page or website
